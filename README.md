# NodeJS Express note taking API
 
This is a simple nodejs express API built with typescript to crud notes using the yarn package manager.

I will be writing a [blogpost] about my thoughts on building a react app with yarn soon.

## This repository has ...
- a nodejs express backend app built using Typescript
- has all the CRUD operations
- you can test it using postman
- uses yarn as a package manager
- test coverage using JEST
- a Postman collection for you to test all the endpoints
